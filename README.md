This is a project that I made during my App Development class. It is a simple calculator app that uses a graphical user interface to allow the user to input specific values and 
perform the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as well as converting the result to percentages. This program can work with 
negative and positive values, as well as decimal values. This project was made using an Android app development tool and programmed in Java. The project has defining features 
such as:
-	 variables that define the first and second number that is input into the program, the result of the operation, and the four listed operations to calculate the result, as 
well as a string variable that the result is saved to, in order to display it to the user in the view box. 

-	A modified onClick() method that detects which buttons are clicked, such as the mathematical operators or numbers.

-	Methods for each button on the calculator that displays the value of the button to the view box, or in the case of the operators, performs the specified operation.
